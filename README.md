# shulker-dupe
A client-side fabric mod that makes it easier to perform the shulker dupe.

---
# Notes

---

Every dupe action ('Dupe All' and 'Dupe') depends on your ping and may not always work correctly.

The 'Dupe' button will always dupe the item in the first shulker box slot. (slot id 0)

All actions are found in the shulker box screen (toggle with the command "^toggleshulkerdupe").
